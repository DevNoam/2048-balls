# 2048 Balls! - Clone

Clone prototype inspired by the game [2048 Balls 3D by voodoo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/2048-balls-3d/id1485247734)

Developed using Unity.

I developed the game mainly to mimic the game mechanism made by voodoo and not the game itself, the game is playable but doesn't contain menus & saves.


## Demo

You can download the latest APK from [releases](https://github.com/sapirnoam/2048-balls/releases/) (WebGL version)

## Roadmap:
- End game scene
- Saving data
- Redesign UI
-  Scoreboard (Online)
- Integrate with Database.


## Contribute
Feel free to fork / Contribute to the project. The game works great both for mobile & PC but only lacks menus & Saves functions.
